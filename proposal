        Hello [Client’s Name],

    I’d really like to work with you on this one if possible!

    I do have a couple of questions, but first I’d like to make you an offer and some background so you can check my work out.

    [Short paragraph explaining your work experience relevant to the job.]

    However, I am new to Upwork and looking to get a few clients that I can build upon. If you take a look at my work and feel that I could help you, I’ll do it for a 10% discount.

    You’ll get all the expected stuff like a great professional service and a fast turn around, at a bit less, and I get a bit more exposure.

    [If applicable, include a link to your portfolio website here, or invite the client to check out the work samples you’ve attached to your proposal.]

    [Ask 1-2 short but relevant questions about the job here. This shows that you’ve read the description and know your stuff, and also invites the client to begin a conversation with you.]

    If the above offer sounds like something you would be interested in, I’d love to hear from you.

    Regards,
    [Your Name]
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

[If applicable: Thank you for your invitation.]

[Share a link to your screencast and briefly explain what it contains. You want to give the client a compelling reason to click the link and watch. Tell them what benefit they will get from it and note that it will only take up a few minutes of their time.]

[1 paragraph explaining why the job appeals to you. Bonus points if you can share why the goals of the client resonate with you personally.]

[1 paragraph sharing an example of your work, ideally closely related to the job you’re applying for.]

If you want to collaborate with me let’s discuss it in more detail over the chat.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
